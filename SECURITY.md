# SECURITY

We're *glad* if you want to report a vulnerability!

If you wish to propose text to explain how to detect and prevent a *kind*
of vulnerability that is already publicly known, please just file a normal
issue and/or pull request. We don't consider that a "vulnerability report"
in the sense that many people use the term.

In some cases we're the wrong place to report vulnerabilities to:

* If you wish to report a vulnerability on a specific project that isn't
  this project, please don't report that here. Instead, please report the
  vulnerability to that project.
* If you wish to report a general vulnerability in edX or the
  Linux Foundation Training & Certification platform, please report the
  vulnerability to them instead.

However, in some cases we *do* want you to report a vulnerability to us:

* If you wish to report a vulnerability in this *specific* course
  as supported by the Linux Foundation (via edX or the Linux Foundation
  Training & Certification platform).
* If you wish to propose text to explain how to detect and prevent a *kind*
  of vulnerability that has *never* been publicly announced or
  discussed anywhere.

If you want to report those kinds of vulnerabilities to us,
please use the GitHub mechanism [privately reporting a security vulnerability](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability) to this repository.
